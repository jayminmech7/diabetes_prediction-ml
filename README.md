# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores the use of various machine learning models to predict the presence of diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

---

## 📊 Objective

To develop and compare classification models that can accurately predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on historical medical data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- train_test_split, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
